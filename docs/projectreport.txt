1. ABSTRACT
This program, TripSOS – Dehradun Help Center, is a menu-driven C application designed to provide quick
assistance during emergency situations. It allows users to select from categories such as car issues, medical
emergencies, and police or safety concerns, and then displays relevant solutions and map suggestions. The
program demonstrates core C concepts including functions, conditional statements, loops, and input
validation, while offering a simple and user-friendly console interface.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. OBJECTIVE
The objective of TripSOS – Dehradun Help Center is to provide quick and easy access to emergency solutions,
contact information, and location guidance for travelers and residents in Dehradun using a simple, interactive
C-based console application.It aims to provide:
* Quick guidance for car issues, medical emergencies, and safety/police concerns.
* Relevant solutions, emergency contact numbers, and map search suggestions.
* A practical demonstration of core C programming concepts such as functions, loops, conditional
  statements, input validation, and console-based user interaction.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. PROBLEM DEFINITION
Travelers and residents in Dehradun may face unexpected emergencies such as car breakdowns, medical
issues, or safety-related incidents. In such situations, finding immediate guidance, emergency contact
numbers, or nearby services can be difficult, especially for someone unfamiliar with the area.

4. SYSTEM DESIGN AND ALGORITHM

* System Design
TripSOS – Dehradun Help Center is a menu-driven C console application designed using a modular
approach. It is divided into multiple functions for better structure, readability, and reusability:

* Modules / Functions

* showHomePage() – Displays the welcome message.
* showMenu() – Shows the main topics (Car Issues, Medical Emergencies, Safety & Police Help).
* showQuestions(topic) – Displays three questions under the selected topic.
* showSolution(topic, question) – Provides the solution for the selected topic and question
* showMapHint(topic, question) – Displays map search suggestions for the selected scenario.
* main() – Handles program flow, input validation, looping, and calls other functions.

* ALGORITHM
1. Start the program.
2. Call showHomePage() to display welcome message.
3. Initialize running = 1.
4. While running is 1:
   a. Call showMenu() to display topics.
   b. Prompt user to enter topic choice.
   c. If input is invalid, display error and continue.
   d. Call showQuestions(topic) to display questions.
   e. Prompt user to enter question choice.
   f. If input is invalid, display error and continue.
   g. Call showSolution(topic, question) to display solution.
   h. Call showMapHint(topic, question) to show map suggestion.
   i. Ask user if they want to search again (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
5. End program and display exit message.

* KEY LANGUAGE FEATURES USED

The TripSOS – Dehradun Help Center demonstrates the use of several important features of the C programming language:

*Functions

Used to modularize the code and perform specific tasks (showMenu(), showQuestions(), showSolution(), etc.).

*Conditional Statements

if-else and switch-case are used to control program flow based on user input.

*Loops

while loop is used to repeat the menu until the user chooses to exit.

*Input/Output (I/O) Operations

printf() is used for displaying menus, messages, and solutions.

scanf() is used for receiving input from the user.

*Input Validation

Ensures only valid numeric input is accepted and prevents program crashes.

*Parameter Passing

Functions take arguments such as topic and question to provide dynamic behavior.

*Standard Library Usage

<stdio.h> is used for basic input-output operations.
